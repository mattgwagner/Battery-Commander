Battery Commander
======================

Battery Commander is a small web application that I'm writing to assist with and maintain a few common unit-level tasks for a military (or other organization) unit.

The intent is for this app to handle creating a "battle roster" listing the personnel assigned by group and position along with qualifications and expiration dates.

Another feature will be tracking the progress of a training event with multiple tasks to be completed by different personnel/groups/positions. This is to give the commander / manager an "at a glance" view of the training event.

The final feature I was planning to implement was an "alert" functionality wherein the commander can sent a short SMS message to a group of personnel with an important message or update.
