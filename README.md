Overview of functionality: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8zPeZ6fdzgo9_fAJvtvi1b1_9XoYQDUw-FCn3P_Ghw/edit?usp=sharing)

Battery Commander is a small web application that I'm writing to assist with and maintain a few common unit-level tasks for a typical Army unit.

The intent is for this app to handle creating a "battle roster" listing the personnel assigned by group and position along with qualifications and expiration dates.

Another feature will be tracking the progress of a training event with multiple tasks to be completed by different personnel/groups/positions. This is to give the commander an "at a glance" view of the training event.

Included tracking is Army Body Composition Program and Army Physical Fitness Tests, including calculations and counseling/worksheet generation.

All development is done by [Red Leg Dev, LLC](https://red-leg-dev.com), which is available for implementation, hosting, and custom development of any Army tools.
